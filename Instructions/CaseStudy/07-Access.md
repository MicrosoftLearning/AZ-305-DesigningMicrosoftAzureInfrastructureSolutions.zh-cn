Tailwind Traders is doing very well and is expanding their workforce. They have successfully acquired an online retailer in the sports apparel space. The company has also located a partner to outsource marketing literature. Tailwind Traders is using Azure Active Directory for user and groups accounts. Here are two specific initiatives the IT department would like you to help with. 

**新用户帐户**

  * The online retailer acquisition will add 75 employees to Tailwind Traders. All the new users have on-premises Active Directory Domain Services accounts in the retailer’s existing domain.

  * The new marketing partner will initially have 15 employees who will need corporate access. These employees already have Azure AD accounts in the partner’s AAD tenant. 

  * The new employees are located at various geographic locations and will need account privileges for their new job roles. Some changes to existing employee roles are expected. 

  * IT 部门希望借此机会加入新的标识安全功能。 

**新的应用程序访问权限**

  * Tailwind Traders 表现非常出色，正在扩大员工队伍。 
  * 还需要本地服务器才能安全地访问 SQL 数据库，而无需在应用程序代码或配置文件中存储凭据。
